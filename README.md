assignment solution 

I decided to go down a sort of DevOps style approach i.e using Continious Integration via Git/GitHub and Test Driven Development via XCTestCase class, but I did not  spend too much time on TDD, although I did incorporate some unit testing. I also followed Apple's Model - View - Controller design & architecture pattern as it's the one I am most comfortable with in comparison to MVVM or VIPER(Not familiar with). I added a view controller which represents the index or home of the application. I also added a registration view controller in order to incorporate data persistence within the app using Core Data. I used an enum to handle the errors in an organised fashion with alert controllers. UIKit handles the complexities of the User interface including Protocol - Delegate communication. I lastly decided to mimic a real world project scenario of parsing JSON via RESTful API's, instead of actually making a network request, i just use a string literal and imitate parsing a HTTP response JSON object.
